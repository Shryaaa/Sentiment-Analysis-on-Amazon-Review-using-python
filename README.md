Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to automatically determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in customer reviews and gain insights into customer opinions about various products.

Features
Data Collection: Scripts to collect and preprocess Amazon review data.
Data Preprocessing: Tools for cleaning and preparing text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Model Training: Implementations of various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and support vector machines (SVM).
Deep Learning: Use of advanced models like LSTM and BERT for improved sentiment prediction accuracy.
Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization: Graphical representation of results to better understand sentiment distribution and model performance.
